By reducing the weight of the rotor, the spool and the bail arm, a lighter rotation without initial resistance is created, thus ensuring optimum smoothness. The 22' Exist is the first reel from the DAIWA program, which is manufactured with the new Airdrive concept. The reduction of the rotor weight not only reduces the effort required for starting, but also enables a faster stopping of the rotor and a quicker reaction to different retrieving speeds.`
